# ðŸ§  CIFAR Multiclass Image Classification

This project implements a **deep learning model** for multiclass image classification using the **CIFAR-10** dataset.  
The goal is to accurately classify images into one of **10 object categories**, including airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses **CIFAR-10 dataset** (60,000 32Ã—32 color images across 10 classes)  
- Built with **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (customizable)  
- Implements **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction  
- Includes **data augmentation** and **regularization** to improve accuracy  
- Supports **training visualization** with TensorBoard / Matplotlib
